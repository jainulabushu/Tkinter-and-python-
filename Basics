In Tkinter everything is widget, button widgets, text widgets, frame widgets, etc,..
1st code: just a window named PewDiePie

from tkinter import *

#first thing to make root widget when using tkinter
root = Tk()

#creating a label
myLabel = Label(root, text= 'PewDiePie')

myLabel.pack()

#final looping
root.mainloop()

Output: a window opens with minimize, maximaize and close buttons with we labled name, we can resize this window as we want.
